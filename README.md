 A PHP script which reads information from a database to generate HTML pages showcasing beetle pictures. The pictures are arranged systematically by suborder/superfamily, family and subfamily. Additional pages for pictures of larvae and some statistics are generated.

Beetles which cannot be identified to species level can be included as well. The scripts also offer the option to generate pages containing only beetles matching certain criteria (anything that can be expressed as an SQL query). An additional script for creating the preview pictures is included as well.

Some parts such as which taxa are included in the systematics or conservation status are written with the German beetle fauna in mind. It is however easy to adapt to other faunas.
